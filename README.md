This deep learning - nlp model understands human emotions and recommends the closest story to it from the book "50 Greatest Short Stories" by Terry O'Brien, so that if a man is struggling with something, a story that is similar to his will be recommended to him so that he can read it and get clarity on how to look ahead in life, and how the story's character dealt with the situation and moved ahead in life.
